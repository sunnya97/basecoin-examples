# Invoicer Plugin

### Description
Invoicer is a basic application which demonstrates how to create an instance
of the basecoin system which utilizes a custom invoicer plugin. The premise of
this plugin is to allow users to pay a fee to create or vote for user-specified
issues. Unique fees are applied when voting or creating a new issue. Fees may
use coin types (for example "voteToken" or "issueToken"). Currently, the
fee to cast a vote is decided by the user when the issue is being generated,
and the fee to create a new issue is defined globally within the plugin CLI
commands (cmd/commands)


### Install
Run `make all` in this directory. This will update all dependencies, run the
test suite, and install the `invoicer` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin`.  

### General Usage
 - create issues with `invoicer tx invoicer create-issue`
   - mandatory flags
     - --from string       Path to a private key to sign the transaction (default "key.json")

     - --issue string     name of the issue to generate or vote for (default "default issue")
     - --voteFee string   the fees required to  vote on this new issue, uses the format <amt><coin>,<amt2><coin2>,... (eg: 1gold,2silver,5btc) (default "1voteToken")

     - --sequence int      Sequence number for the account (-1 to autocalculate}, (default -1)
 - vote for issues with `invoicer tx invoicer vote` and flags listed below
   - mandatory flags
     - --from string       Path to a private key to sign the transaction (default "key.json")
     - --amount string     Coins to send in transaction of the format <amt><coin>,<amt2><coin2>,... (eg: 1btc,2gold,5silver},
     - --issue string   name of the issue to generate or vote for (default "default issue")
     - --voteFor        if present vote will be a vote-for, if absent a vote-against
   - optional flags
     - --node string       Tendermint RPC address (default "tcp://localhost:46657")
     - --chain_id string   ID of the chain for replay protection (default "test_chain_id")
     - --coin value         Specify a coin denomination (default: "blank")
     - --gas int           The amount of gas for the transaction
     - --fee string        Coins for the transaction fee of the format <amt><coin>
     - --sequence int      Sequence number for the account (-1 to autocalculate}, (default -1)
 - query the state of an issue using the command `invoicer query p2vIssue [yourissuename]`

### Example CLI Usage
First perform the initialization commands:

```
invoicer init
invoicer unsafe_reset_all
```

For the default genesis file provided (~/.basecoin/genesis.json) we have specified a starting account at the hex 
address 0x1B1BE55F969F54064628A63B9559E7C21C925165 to have 1000 coins of "issueToken", and "voteToken". 
The address, public key, and private key for this account are also stored under ~/.basecoin/key.json
Now we can start invoicer:

```
invoicer start 
```

In another terminal window (or tab: ctrl-shift-t), we can run the client tool:

```
invoicer account 0x1B1BE55F969F54064628A63B9559E7C21C925165
```
The above transaction will check for an account with the given hex address and
list any coins within that account. We should see the initialized amount of
1000 issueToken, and voteToken. The default cost of generating a new issue 1
issueToken and is currently hard coded into invoicer, let's create an issue
which can be voted on. Notice the flags that are used in this proceedure:
 - `--from key.json` the transaction is coming from the account described within the key.json file under our current directory
 - `--voteFee 1voteToken` set the future cost of voting for this issue to 1 voteToken
 - `--amount 1issueToken` the amount of coins we are sending in with this transaction, in this case 1 issueToken 
 - `--issue freeFoobar` name of the issue we will be generating with this transaction

```
invoicer tx invoicer create-issue --from key.json --voteFee 1voteToken --amount 1issueToken --issue freeFoobar
```

Now we can query for our issue as see that it has been created and that no votes have yet been cast:

```
invoicer query p2vIssue freeFoobar
```

Next let's make a few votes, first we will vote for the issue once, and then against the issue twice

```
invoicer tx invoicer vote --from key.json --amount 1voteToken --issue freeFoobar --voteFor
invoicer tx invoicer vote --from key.json --amount 1voteToken --issue freeFoobar
invoicer tx invoicer vote --from key.json --amount 1voteToken --issue freeFoobar
```

To view the votes that have been cast query the transaction once more

```
invoicer query p2vIssue freeFoobar
```

Lastly we can verify that we have in fact spent 1 issueToken and 3 voteToken,

```
invoicer account 0x1B1BE55F969F54064628A63B9559E7C21C925165
```

### Thoughts for future development
 - Creating multiple vote options at issue generation (such as options or candidate name)
 - Alternative voting methods (for example ranked voting system)
   - Determine the type of voting mechanism when creating the issue
 - Allow votes to 'write in' their own candidate or spoil their ballot
 - Methods for the distributions of vote tokens
